There is a limiation when concurrent projects creation actions happen. Whatever one user create multiple projects or different user create projects at the same time.

The behavior in the UI is "Project has created successfully" reported but the new created project is not shown in Project list.

Explaination:
When the user initiates project-creation via Web-UI, it goes to "Jetty-process", which in turn constructs the required "dsengine-command-string" & spawns a separate process and executes that comment. At this point, we see the following messages in the Jetty-log-file: "/opt/IBM/InformationServer/ASBNode/CognitiveDesignerEngine/dfdEngineServer.log":

Root Cause:
The root-cause of the issue is because "Jetty-process" failed to run the project-creation-command & hence, the last-log-entry in the jetty-log-file: is the "create command ....." shown above. We encountered such scenario, when multiple "project-create" commands are issued (one after another or at the same time), either by the same user (or) multiple-users. However, if we create projects one at a time, wait till it is created, connect to that project and then try creating another project (if required), then we did not encounter any issue.

So, the bottom-line is, the Jetty-process is hitting some kind of "resouce-contention" (i.e., something similar to "deadlock" in databases) & not executing the required commands, resulting in project-creation failures. In such situations, restarting "Jetty-process" will abort the exiting transactions (which are resulting in resource-contention or deadlock...etc) & start the Jetty-process cleanly. Re-starting of Jetty-process does NOT cause any "loss of data". So, restarting Jetty-process doesn't cause any problem. (In fact, we recommend "jetty-restart", whenever WAS-ND/LWAS is restarted for any reason).

Kiran explained that, we have long-time plan to resolve the concurrent-project-creation issue in future-releases. But, the general recommendation now is to create projects one at a time, wait till it is created, connect to that project and then try creating another project (if required).

Workaround:
If the customer encounters a situation where they see the project-creation-command as the last-entry in the Jetty-log & that process is not running (if they see via "ps -ef | grep QUICKADD"), then user can consider restarting Jetty-process, as a workaround.

Restarting Jetty, would NOT cause any loss of data (nor any problem with any of the subsequent-operations), but only aborts the existing (i.e., the ones which are "hanging") transactions & starts clean. FYI.
